# The SIMAS Language Support
*Created by: Turrnut*<br>
**SIMAS**, which is an acronym for **SIM**ple **AS**sembly, is a dynamically typed, compiled,
high level, procedural programming language with a syntax that is inspired
by the Assembly programming language. In SIMAS, each line starts with an instruction,
optionally followed by one or more operands, just like Assembly.<br>

The instruction and its operands are separated a space character and one space only. If there are
multiple spaces, the program might enter unexpected behavior. Also, lines of code are separated by semicolons, as new lines are ignored. <br>
